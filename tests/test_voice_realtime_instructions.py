"""The Live voice contract: Gemini Live stays available for conversation while
Hermes works in the background as a worker.

The token endpoint locks the whole session (model, voice, instructions, tools) into an
ephemeral token, so ``realtime_instructions`` and the two tool declarations are the ONLY
place that shapes the spoken model's behaviour. These tests pin that contract:

- the front agent never blocks on background work and respects user pauses;
- ``ask_jarvis`` is the quick bridge (answer usually comes straight back);
- ``delegate_to_hermes`` hands off substantial work and returns immediately, then the
  finished report arrives as a ``Raport wspolpracownika`` message to summarize and announce;
- both tools are declared in every session setup (OpenAI Realtime and Gemini Live).
